## Memory Network

---

The model can be found under `models/memory_network.lua`, along with baseline models lstm and gru. (`models/lstm.lua` and `models/gru.lua`)

The current `main.lua` replicates the Basic Question-Answering task described in the paper, but the implementation should be able to handle other tasks.

Results are stored in `results`
